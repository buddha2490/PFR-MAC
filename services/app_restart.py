"""Relaunch the PFR Sentinel process — last-resort recovery from a ZWO SDK
wedge that nothing in-process can clear.

When the SDK DLL corrupts (concurrent access, or a USB stack hang) the capture
thread blocks forever inside an uninterruptible C call, and on a rig that isn't
running as Administrator the USB device reset is unavailable too. A fresh
process loads a clean copy of ASICamera2.dll, so for a 24/7 unattended rig a
process restart is the only reliable cure.

The single-instance guard (services/single_instance.py) holds a QLocalServer
lock, so the replacement must not start until THIS process has exited and
released it. We launch a small detached PowerShell waiter that blocks on our
PID, settles briefly, then starts a new instance — and then the caller quits
the app cleanly. Windows-only by design (the app ships Windows-only).
